        Hello! I’m Seth Miller and I’m a Full Stack Web Developer. In the past
        I’ve dabbled in scientific research and teaching High School science,
        but now I’m focussing my passions for collaboration, problem solving,
        and continuous learning into building websites. I consider myself a
        jack-of-all-trades and I love to wear many different hats including
        musician, trail runner, and professional disc golfer.
